##### Hall_Rating.R

This file:
1. Cleans raw BBRef data dump
2. Estimates historic BPM from WS/48 and MPG
3. Develops Estimated Aging Curves
4. Derives "Era Adjustments" based on year-to-year changes, adjusted for aging
5. Adjusts older era playoffs and seasons to be more analogous to the current era
6. Compiles a Hall Rating based on peak and longevity, incorporating all of these adjustments.


All other files are basically helper files.  A number of old iterations of Hall Rating outputs are present in the directory.
